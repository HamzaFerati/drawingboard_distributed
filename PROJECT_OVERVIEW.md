# Distributed Drawing Board - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

This project implements a real-time collaborative drawing application that demonstrates advanced distributed systems concepts through a peer-to-peer architecture. The system enables multiple users to draw simultaneously on a shared canvas while maintaining consistency, fault tolerance, and automatic recovery across distributed nodes.

## Project Overview

The Distributed Drawing Board is a web-based collaborative drawing application where multiple users can draw together in real-time. Unlike traditional client-server architectures, this system implements a true distributed approach where each browser tab operates as an autonomous node in a peer-to-peer network. The application demonstrates core distributed systems principles including consensus algorithms, leader election, state synchronization, and fault tolerance.
